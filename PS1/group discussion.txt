Thermal Power is the main source of electricity generation in India. It stands at 230.6 GW out of which 198.5 is from coal alone. According to the new standards thermal power plants are expected to cut emissions and usage of water measurably. It is not clear what the penalties for failure might be, especially in the short-run. One of the biggest challenges in the thermal power sector is variance. The coal power plants vary in age, technology, size, location, ownership, load factor, etc. The Hirono No. 5 Thermal Power Station of Tokyo Electric Power Company is a coal-fired thermal power plant has adopted the ultra-super critical (USC) conditions of 24.5 MPa × 600/600°C, the highest level in the world. This coal-fired thermal power plant has the efficiency of 43% at generator terminal.
